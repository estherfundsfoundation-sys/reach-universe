REACH UNIVERSE — FUTURISTIC PLATFORM UPDATE

This version adds a real animated campus-universe look, student-facing program information, REACH Box requests, ambassador interest applications, a member portal, community wall, directory, chat room, and consent-based media uploads.

WHAT WORKS AS SOON AS THIS FOLDER IS UPLOADED

- The neon futuristic site, moving grid, light-trail atmosphere, and character showcase.
- Program guide, seven pathways, Workshop I and II links, official SNAP resource links, REACH Box page, and ambassador page.

WHAT NEEDS SUPABASE BEFORE IT CAN ACCEPT REAL MEMBER ACTIVITY

The portal, directory, wall, chat, Box requests, ambassador applications, and photo uploads are built into this package, but need the database connection switched on:

1. In Supabase, run reach-supabase.sql in the SQL Editor.
2. Create a private Storage bucket named reach-media.
3. Put the project API URL and publishable key in reach-config.js.

Do not put a Supabase secret key in reach-config.js or on this website.
